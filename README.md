# Travel App


## Description 
We proudly present our innovative Travel App, crafted to streamline a user's holiday planning experience. 
This user-friendly application serves as the ultimate guide, offering a comprehensive overview of highly recommended hotels at the user's chosen destination. Beyond this, it seamlessly connects the user to local restaurants, bars, pubs, entertainment and cultural spaces and activities conveniently situated within close proximity to their selected hotel.
We have additionally incorporated a map feature for effortless navigation to these spaces. 

Our dedication to a streamlined and simplified user experience led us to develop this as a one-page application, ensuring intuitive usability and a smooth customer journey.
